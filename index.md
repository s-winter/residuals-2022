# <span style="color:red">Important: Workshop Canceled</span>

<span style="color:red">Due to a combination of unforeseen circumstances, the workshop cannot take place as planned. <br/>
After careful consideration, we have decided to cancel the workshop. <br/>
We apologize to all registered participants and the FSE organizers for the inconveniences this entails.</span>

# Workshop Scope

This workshop is about studying residual software bugs in critical
systems, i.e., bugs that escape strict quality assurance and trigger
failures during operation. Software systems can introduce fault
tolerance to compensate for effects of residual bugs at run-time,
but there is a need to better understand these effects, and how to
simulate these effects to evaluate fault-tolerant systems. The
workshop aims to systematize the state of the art/practice and
open problems on this field, by inviting talks from experts in the
fields of software engineering, fault tolerance, and security.

A more detailed description of the workshop topic is available [here](topic.html).

# Time and Place

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE) 2022.
